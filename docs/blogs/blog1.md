# Some thoughts in Croissants's project

First of all, I really liked your project pitch and the idea of giving people a way to stargaze. I remember the first time I went to the country side, far away from the city and any other urban centers, and seeing the sky lit up with a beatiful collage of stars was an experience I would never forget. I believe lots of people haven't seen the full display of the night sky and I think your app would be a great way to entice people to seek out these experiences.

While thinking about your project, I thought about an idea that could help reach your goal for people to stargaze. While auroras are really cool and definitely worth it to see, there are also other cosmic events that might be really cool to see too. One example are cosmic showers. In addition, we know when these events happen far in advance. So, I was wondering if making a calendar of possible cosmic events, where users can schedule an event if they think is close enough for them to see and be able to plan ahead.

Furthermore, another idea I had is to have a constellation scavanger hunt, where the app presents the user a collection of costellations, and the user has to be able to find them and take a picture of such costellation. It could serve as a fun game feature and could also have a sort of leaderboard of the person who collects the most costellations.
