# Assignment 2

## Design Document

### Name and Audience

For this project, my main audience is going to be 13-25 years old who want to socialize/chat about some topic but it is open to everyone. The goal is to create a website where people are able to share and socialize about something they are a fan off or have in common. For example, you are a fan of a streamer and you want to share some fanart, or you want to find a gaming group. In addition, it should serve as a safe place for people to find and form small groups/communities, in the same vein of a group of friends. In a way, to lower the barrier of entry to reach out to other people and be able to start random casual conversantions.

Finally, the code name of this project is **MeetOut**.

### Feature Design Ideas

1. **Interactive Virtual Space**: A space where you roam around and find people to start or join conversations. These interaction can happen in a central lounge, a bench, near a tree, etc where there is a concentration of people. In addition, you can interact with elements made by the community in these virtual spaces or even add your own element/post.

2. **Costumized Free-form profiles**: Considered a normal profile who's structure is up to the user. Here, an user can add their own banners, a news letter, a blog post, a picture board, etc. which are given by the website. The user can costumize the style, colors, font of the profile making it more personal kinda like the profiles from social media in the late 2000's and early 2010's.

3. **Complete post transparency**: Each post, message, picture, art, or anything submitted by an user is open to the public. In other words, there is not a concept of DM's or private conversations. Another way to put it, is that anyone can join and checkout a conversation/chat.

4. **Proximity Chat**: When you get to a specific distance from another user or group of users, you can either hear their conversation and talk to them. In addition, we can apply this feature with text chat where you are only able to send and receive texts in a certain range to another user.

5. **Communites/Hubs Search and Promotion**: In the platform, you are able to explore different hubs/groups who might have similar interests to you. In addition, the search can be physical where you can explore a row of different rooms that lead you to some hub/community and these communities can promote themselves through this virtual lobby.

6. **Rating System**: Each server/community and each user would have a rating score (ie. a 5 star rating system like in restaurants) which each user can give a rating and review. Then, we rate this servers/communities so users can join the best hubs. Furthermore, lower rated communities might be sent to an admin review or deleted. Similarly, a lower rated user might have features limitated, sent to a review or just banned given the circumstance.

7. **Small-Medium Capped Server/Group**: While big servers might have the appeal to users as they might have a lot of engagement and serve as a mini social media focused on a niche, it might be hard to form meaningful connections and have deep conversations. Thus, having a smaller server who might be capped to 20-30 members, it might be easier for a user to form these types of connections, similarly to like a group of friends.

8. **Community Board**: Each hub/server/community could have a white board where people can share art, post messages, collaborate on projects, etc. which could serve as a more interactive way of participating on the community. In addition, you can show this board to other users who might be interested to join.

9. **Community/User Moderation**: Given the nature of the platform audience, it is important to have extensive moderation. Thus, each of the community user's can report on a post that might violate the rules, and given enough reports that could be the majority of the community, the post would be removed and the post's user might be penalized.

10. **Personal Rooms**: In addition to a user profile, an user can personlized and create a space which could serve as an expansion of their profile. For example, the media tab of a user profile might be an actual wallboard on the room. Furthermore, other users can visit and give comments.

11. **Custom Avatars and Skins**: Each user can also personalize themselves with custom avatars as a fun way to showcase their personality. Also, it lowers the entry of starting conversations as it less serious and more casual if you are talking as a banana with glasses for example.

12. **Event Hosting**: Each user/community can reserve, host and promote an event for their community or friends. These can be like watch parties, new album listen parties, live reactions, etc.

13. **Friends/Block List**: While going from server to server, a user might find other users who like to hang out with and so they might like to be friends, just like in real life. Here, each user can invite and recieve invites to other communities who their friends are part of and join their group of friends. In the other hand, if a user doesn't like someone, they can block them and not have to engage with the other user. This could extend to bans from certain communities and so on.

14. **Casual Games**: One of the ways people engage with friends is through games, especially table top games like Chess, Catan, Exploding Kittens, etc. Thus, we could have a online version of these games and some other online games like Skriblio and Gartic Phone as a form of interacting with other users. It could serve as a nice bonding activity.

15. **Live Music and Playlists**: Here, each user can queue different songs to add as the backgroud music for each lobby. In addition, users can share their playlists or have a community playlist.

16. **Warning, Reminders, and Advice**: For each time a user is using a feature for the first time, they'll be given a pop-up or reminder about the dangers of posting stuff online. In addition, there'll be permanent warnings always highlitting possible dangerous stuff. Finally, from time to time, the platform would give advice to the user on how to counteract/limit these situations.

17. **Live Transcription**: As a form to bridge voice chat and text chat, every time a user says something it'll be displayed as a text message, so people who are unable to listen can participate in the conversation.

18. **Artificial Voice**: For people who can't speak and use voice chat, there is an option to use an artificial voice so they can participate in a vocal conversation.

19. **Time Limit**: Each day you only have a limited time to participate and engage on different activities throughout the hub/community. For example, you might have a limited to check and post in a community board and thus the user tries to maximize their time usage.

20. **Daily Leaderboard**: Each day, users of a community can vote on art, a post, a blog or even a user. Then, at the end of the day, there will be a leaderboad containing these elements and the top post of the day gets highlited for the whole community.

### VSD Analysis

- For considering children in stakeholders, it is very important for my project given the nature of its intended audience leans towards younger people. Thus, features like feature 16 (Warning, Reminders, and Advice), are important to create a safe place for users of any age and make them always aware of the possible dangerous situations that can occur. A child might not know better, but they can read and be attentive. Henceforth, with enough reminders they can be made aware. Still, moderation should lie mostly on the platform itself, and so a daily check of the most popular communities with a priority on checking on reports is key to making the platform safe. Using a combination of these strategies, should be able to mitigate any issues that could arise.

- For sustained friendships in time, I think this project could help build new friendships through like the feature of small capped servers, which promotes the idea of making close connections, and also gives another avenue for people to interact outside the real world which might be either harder or not as comfortable. However, user might depend too much on the platform and so a possible solution is to remind the user to take a break and limit their time on the app. This should encourage users to seek out other relations outside the online sphere.

- For crossing national boundaries in pervasiveness, a feature like virtual public spaces helps eliminate these kind of barriers, and people can engage in the comfort of their homes. On the other hand, there is the problem of language barriers who might be a problem given the conversational nature of the app. Thus, having a robust translation system that can translate messages and voice chats in real time help aleviate the barrier of entry.

- For choosing desired values, I want my project to give a sense of transparency, community and trust. Some feature that helps highlight these values are the complete message transparency, community/hubs, and the rating system. With these features together, a user should be able to choose and adjust which communities they want to participate the most given the content they have and avoid any low rated or suspicious users/servers. We can go further by creating a recommendation algorithm that takes on account the user's preferences and promote certain communities that they might like.

- For widespread use in pervasiveness, a feature like community/hub search and rating system can help the user find a group that vibes with them the most. In addition, with more users, it is easier to find a group that they'll like. Still, there might be too many groups to look for, and so, maybe having the ability to showcase less known communities (either randomly or by an algorithm) could help both the server/community and the user to reach out to each other.
