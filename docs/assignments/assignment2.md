# Assignment 2

## Design Document

### Name and Audience

For this project, my main audience is going to be 13-25 years old who want to socialize/chat about some topic but it is open to everyone. The goal is to create a website where people are able to share and socialize about something they are a fan off or have in common. For example, you are a fan of a streamer and you want to share some fanart, or you want to find a gaming group. In addition, it should serve as a safe place for people to find and form small groups/communities, in the same vein of a group of friends. In a way, to lower the barrier of entry to reach out to other people and help learn the stakeholders/users how to socialize.

Finally, the code name of this project is **MeetOut**.
