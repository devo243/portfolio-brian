# Assignment 3

### Pitch

artBook is a social media dedicated for fans of any topic (games, TV Series, Books, Youtubers, Streamers, etc.) that want to share their own fanart or drawings about the topic and check out new content related to it. Compared to other social media, either the content is image-based but it is hard to compile all the art of a specific topic, or the content is specific to the topic, but art is not the main type of content and such it is not as prioritized.

Thus, artBook is designed to give easier access to fanart content, by creating communities that gather such content in one place and the content itself is only image-based. artBook achieves this goal by the concept of Community where content is aggregated through these communities and not through a global feed. In addition, through Image Posting the only content that is shown to users is in image form and so fanart/drawings are prioritized in this medium. Hence, artBook is determined to be a simple, quick, and easy way to engage and share fanart content to the fans.
