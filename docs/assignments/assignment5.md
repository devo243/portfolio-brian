## Heuristic Evaluation

---

### Usability Criteria

#### Discoverability

- There are a lot of buttons that are not labelled in the interface, that can be implied by the icons but it's not obvious what they suppose to mean.
- For example, the posting button is a plus in my wireframe, which could be interpreted as an adding community button instead. In addition, there is no label for the community buttons and so it is not easy to tell which exact community corresponds with the button.
- A tradeoff would be to label some buttons in my UI with text, but it would clash with Pleasantness as it would bloat the UI with icons and text.

#### Efficiency

- In terms of efficiency, searching for communities and adding posts are just like one to three button/clicks presses away which is pretty efficient.
- In addition, you can quickly access communities that you check frequently in the home page with a single click/button press.
- However, if you want to access all the other communities, you might need to scroll or click another button to get a list of all the communities which is not as efficient.
- Instead, we could look on expanding the UI to have all communities but it would affect the Pleasantness of the website as there might not be enough space for everything to fit.

### Physical Heuristics

#### Situational Context

- Every page in my website is very distinct, with each page having it's own structure. Thus, the user is able to identify which page they are on. For example, if it is the home feed, or the search page, or the posting page.
- The only case that is against this is the feed for both the home page and the community page being both scroll feeds that are pretty similar, so it's not clear if the content is based around the user featured posts or community posts.
- An idea I have is to either modify the structure of the community feed as a horizontal scroll feed instead, but it might conflict consistency and it would also be more confusing for the user affecting discoverability.

#### Gestalt Principles

- There is a clear grouping between the concepts of posts, communities, feed and featuring in the home page.

- In the community page, there are two different sections, one related to feed and the other to the community itself that are clearly defined and separated.

- The only caveat is that my bottom bar and my top bar have similar functions in terms of accessing different user pages (posting, user page, home page, etc.), and maybe instead having just a sidebar with all these buttons it might be easier to tell the user that it is just like menu for pages.

- However, it might affect efficiency as everything would need like an extra click to access.

### Linguistic Level

#### Consistency

- Each icon on the UI corresponds to its functionality. For example, the home button is in the shape of a home, the search button is searching glass, the posting button is a plus like adding a post, and when you create a post there is a default picture icon which implies that you can only post images.

- In addition, there is consistency with shapes, where each profile picture is a circle (user, community), while a post is either a square or a rectangle.

- The only incosistency is the font size for different labels which might not look as pleasant.

#### Speak a User's Language

- I think each label is easy to understand what it means and all buttons are clear what they do.
